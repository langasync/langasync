Additional Use Grant:

You may make use of the Licensed Work for any purpose (including commercial
and production use), provided that you do not offer the Licensed Work as a
hosted or managed service, or as part of a commercial service, that directly
or indirectly competes with the Licensor.

For clarity, a “Competing Service” is a commercial offering that allows third
parties (other than your employees and contractors) to access the functionality
of the Licensed Work as a service (including but not limited to SaaS, hosted,
or managed offerings), where the service’s primary value is derived from the
Licensed Work or exposes substantially similar functionality.

Use of the Licensed Work solely for internal business purposes is not
considered a Competing Service.
